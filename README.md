# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to generate summary statistics for the temperatures during the months of June and December to determine the sustainability of the ice cream shop at different points of the year.

## Results: 

1. **June**: The mean temperature for the month of June was **74.9 F**.

2. **December**: The mean tempatures for the mont of December was **71.0 F**.

3. The greatest difference between June and December data exists in the **min temperature**, which is approximately 8 degrees cooler in December compared to June.

## Summary
### High-Level Summary
While the mean temperatures do not show a very large temperature gradient between June and December, the larger standard deviation for the month of December indicates greater temperature fluctuation.

### Additional Queries
We should perform the following two additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December:

1. We should also compare the Median of the two data sets to see if any of the June or December data are skewed. This is important as the count of values between the datasets differ.
2. We should split the data further by days in each month and create average daily temperature bins to understand how many days in December were close to the min temperature.
